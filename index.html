        <span id="span1">Gaming</span>
    </h1>
    <p>I play Games because they allow you to experience excitement and danger all from the safety of your chair. You can play games that give you the opportunity to do things you never would be able to do in real-life. Fight a demon monster, fly on a giant pre-historic eagle, or complete extreme missions on a special forces team. Okay, so you could join the military and be on a special forces team. But many video games allow us to experience things we never could do in the physical world.</p>
